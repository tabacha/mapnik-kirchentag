This style closely follows the "German" Mapnik style which follows the original
Mapnikstyle 
(svn.openstreetmap.org/applications/rendering/mapnik). All
instructions and helper programs from that directory apply
equally to here, and changes made to that style could, and
often should, be patched in here as well. 

This German Style has been developed by Beate Braun for her Bachelor
Thesis at HFT Stuttgart, with support from Geofabrik. The 
style is made freely available here for anyone to use, subject
to any constraints possibly inherited from the original Mapnik
style.

This style is in use at http://www.openstreetmap.de/.
